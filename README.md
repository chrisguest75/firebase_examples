```sh
# install pre-commmit (prerequisite for commitizen)
brew install pre-commit
brew install commitizen
# conventional commits extension
code --install-extension vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits

# install hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```

## Prerequisites
